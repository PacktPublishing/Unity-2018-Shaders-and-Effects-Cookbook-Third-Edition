## What is this book about?

Since their introduction to Unity, shaders have been seen as notoriously difficult to understand and implement in games. Complex mathematics has always stood in the way of creating your own shaders and attaining the level of realism you crave.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand physically based rendering to fit the aesthetic of your game
* Write shaders from scratch in ShaderLab and HLSL/Cg
* Combine shader programming with interactive scripts to add life to your materials
* Design efficient shaders for mobile platforms without sacrificing their realism
* Use state-of-the-art techniques, such as volumetric explosions and fur shading
